> toy)_xml2df_mybatis_20190511~

```
these day I am migrating oracle to postgre
simple DDL, DML works quite well with ora2pg library.

but mybatis xml file has too much cases.
So wanted to see a glimpse of file info before changing
working at a 'sql performance tuning' corp, there's really too much sqls..

As a Java developer, think python is much better for demos
